# my vit website

 This project work is a part of the DSN-2098 Project Exhibition submitted to the Department of Computing Science and Engineering.
Our objective is to create a product in form of a Website and an Android application, facilitating information regarding our college and its activities that our target audience, VITians, is already familiar with.
It includes a forum where classmates can interact with each other, post important information and ask queries about ongoing assignments and classes.
This project has been designed to be suitable for all year students and would be having user friendly interface.

Our project focuses on both the students studying in our university and people seeking the information related to the university.

We are planning to make a fully functioning general information website.
We will also be building an easy to use android app along with it.

The general information will be available openly to everyone whereas for some particular information the students need to login using their username and password.

The students would also be provided with a login portal for personal diary.

A forum, “Chatbox” has been fashioned for the users too.

Initially the website and the app contain limited data but it can be extended further by adding more information and the number of users.
